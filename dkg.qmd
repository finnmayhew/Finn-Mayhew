Devil's Kettle Games was a project by myself and Haley Carter.

I wrote and scored the games, and Haley coded the first one and helped with the story for both.

### Context

From 2017-2019, Shift was in development hell.

In 2019, we decided to release the game as a Google Docs file.

There's pseudocode to guide you though the intended logic of the gameplay:

Unfortunately, you're going to have to keep track of a few variables yourself.

The most notable of these is canReturn - see the instructions on page 6.

Yellow text is links. When you see "continue here" in grey, the text "here" is a link.

Tabbed-in text is meant to be read only once.
