    "text": "IceCube\n\nPhoto credit: Emanuel Jacobi, IceCube/NSF\nFor my PhD at Michigan State University, I’m working with MSU’s IceCube group under Dr. Tyce DeYoung.\nIceCube is both a telescope and a detector. As a telescope, it uses elementary particles called neutrinos to see very high-energy happenings very far away. As a detector, it allows the collaboration to study the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves.\nMy work with IceCube aims to look for non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) through the experiment’s oscillations measurements, which look at neutrinos that originate in the atmosphere and travel thr ough the Earth to the detector at the South Pole. NSI is a beyond-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics (BSM) effect that is predicted by several hypotheses of the origin of neutrino mass. Below is a graphic that outlines the analysis procedure.\n\n\nLearn more about IceCube in general\nWander through the notes that I’m taking to understand NSI\nWatch my first guidance committee meeting talk, where I presented my research up to the point of joining the OscNext NSI team\nPlay with a neutrino oscillation visualizer\nLook at 10 years of up-going muon neutrinos detected by IceCube"

Eventually we’ll collaborate with researchers at SLAC on this."
