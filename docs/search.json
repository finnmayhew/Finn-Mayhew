    "text": "IceCube\n\nPhoto credit: Emanuel Jacobi, IceCube/NSF\nFor my PhD at Michigan State University, Iâ€™m working with MSUâ€™s IceCube group under Dr.Â Tyce DeYoung.\nIceCube is both a telescope and a detector. As a telescope, it uses elementary particles called neutrinos to see very high-energy happenings very far away. As a detector, it allows the collaboration to study the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves.\nMy work with IceCube aims to look for non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) through the experimentâ€™s oscillations measurements, which look at neutrinos that originate in the atmosphere and travel thr ough the Earth to the detector at the South Pole. NSI is a beyond-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics (BSM) effect that is predicted by several hypotheses of the origin of neutrino mass. Below is a graphic that outlines the analysis procedure.\n\n\nLearn more about IceCube in general\nWander through the notes that Iâ€™m taking to understand NSI\nWatch my first guidance committee meeting talk, where I presented my research up to the point of joining the OscNext NSI team\nPlay with a neutrino oscillation visualizer\nLook at 10 years of up-going muon neutrinos detected by IceCube"
