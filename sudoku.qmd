- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- Digits separated by an "X" sum to 10.
- Digits separated by a "V" sum to 5.

- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- Digits within cages sum to the number indicated.
- Digits along a thermometer increase from the bulb end.
- Thin lines form palindromes — that is, a digit some distance along a line from one end also appears the same distance along the line from the other end.
