For my PhD at Michigan State University, I'm working with MSU's IceCube group under Dr. Tyce DeYoung.

IceCube is both a telescope and a detector. As a telescope, it uses fundamental particles called neutrinos to see very high-energy happenings very far away. As a detector, it allows the collaboration to study the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves.

My work with IceCube aims to help pin down some of the neutrino oscillation parameters, which describe how neutrinos change their type as they travel. To do this, we look at neutrinos that originate in the atmosphere and travel through the Earth to the detector at the South Pole.

## Instrumentation traineeship

Starting spring 2023, I will begin research in MSU's high-energy detector instrumentation traineeship program. Details to come!

## NOνA

As an undergrad at William & Mary, I worked with W&M's NOνA group under Dr. Patricia Vahle.

NOνA is also a neutrino experiment, except instead of looking at neutrinos from space or Earth's atmosphere, it produces its own neutrinos at an accelerator and shoots them through the Earth to a detector, also with the aim of studying their fundamental properties.

My work helped with the calibration of the experiment's far detector and test beam beamline instrumentation.
