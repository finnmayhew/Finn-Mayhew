For my PhD at Michigan State University, I'm working with MSU's IceCube group under Dr. Tyce DeYoung.

IceCube is both a telescope and a detector. As a telescope, it uses neutrinos (instead of light) to see very high-energy happenings very far away. As a detector, it allows the collaboration to study the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves, such as their oscillation parameters.

As an undergrad at William & Mary, I worked with W&M's NOνA group under Dr. Patricia Vahle.

NOνA is also a neutrino experiment, except instead of looking at neutrinos from space or Earth's atmosphere, it produces its own neutrinos and shoots them through the Earth to a detector, also with the aim of studying their fundamental properties.
