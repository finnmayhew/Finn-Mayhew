For my PhD at Michigan State University, I'm working with MSU's IceCube group under Dr. Tyce DeYoung.

IceCube is both a telescope and a detector. As a telescope, it uses elementary particles called neutrinos to see very high-energy happenings very far away. As a detector, it allows the collaboration to study the fundamental properties of neutrinos themselves.

My work with IceCube aims to help pin down some of the neutrino oscillation parameters, which describe how neutrinos change their type as they travel. To do this, we look at neutrinos that originate in the atmosphere and travel through the Earth to the detector at the South Pole.

[Here's](https://philippeller.github.io/osc.html) a tool for visualizing neutrino oscillations.

[Here's](https://user-web.icecube.wisc.edu/~lulu/globe_AR/webcity/ngc1068/) a tool for visualizing 10 years of up-going muon neutrinos detected by IceCube.

## LIG Testing

As part of MSU's TRAIN-MI high-energy physics detector instrumentation traineeship program, under Dr. Kendall Mahn I'm creating and testing the properties of laser-induced graphene for potential use as a material for a field cage in a time projection chamber in space that would detect astrophysical gamma rays. Eventually we'll collaborate with researchers at SLAC on this.

## NOνA

As an undergrad at William & Mary, I worked with W&M's NOνA group under Dr. Patricia Vahle.

NOνA is also a neutrino experiment, except instead of looking at neutrinos from space or Earth's atmosphere, it produces its own neutrinos at an accelerator and shoots them through the Earth to a detector to study their fundamental properties.

My work helped with the calibration of the experiment's far detector and test beam beamline instrumentation.
